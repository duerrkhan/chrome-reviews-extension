# Chrome Reviews

Chrome reviews is a Chrome Browser Extension that aggregates reviews
for particular places (restaurants, repair shops, spas, ...) into a 
uniform interface that allows the user to make a better decision.

This project contains two components.  The server files can be run
remotely or locally.  They will be needed to have the client
communicate to various third party APIs. The client code can be 
directly imported into the Chrome Browser.  The client code consists of
a `manifest.json` file that sets the parameters for the extension.
